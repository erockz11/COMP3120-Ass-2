# General Workflow

Anything in the `main` branch is considered deployable.

When working on code, please create a new branch with a descriptive name, such as `implementing-api-endpoints` and then work on and commit code there.

Once you are done, created a pull request to merge changes into the `main` branch\
`Github Desktop` > `Branch` > `Create pull request` > `Create pull request (on github.com)` > `Merge pull request` > `Confirm merge` > `Delete branch`

You can ask others to review your code and have them complete the pull request.
